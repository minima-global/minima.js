Minima is a cryptocurrency designed to be ultra-compact. Designed to remain Totally Decentralised. Designed to have no rulers. There are no miners and no ever-growing database. A simple yet powerful scripting language, Cascading Proof Chain, adaptive block scaling, and an innovative Proof of Work (PoW) backed user-centric blockchain algorithm that uses both on-chain and off-chain traffic for security. All Quantum Secure Cryptography. Small enough to run efficiently on your mobile phone. Everyone runs a complete node. Forever.

Minima.js is the means by which it is is possible to build distributed applications that access the Minima blockchain.
